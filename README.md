# Fine Tuning LLMs with Hugging Face

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using the Hugging Face library. The notebook included is designed to be a practical resource for anyone interested in enhancing the performance of pre-trained language models for specific tasks.

The tuned model in this notebook will list the symptoms of a disease fed as input

## Features

- **Environment Setup**: Instructions to set up the necessary environment and dependencies within Google Colab.
- **Data Preparation**: Guide on preparing the dataset for fine-tuning.
- **Model Selection**: Information on choosing an appropriate pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Model Hub.
- **Training**: Detailed steps to train the model with custom data.
- **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model.
- **Inference**: How to use the fine-tuned model for making predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Google account for accessing Google Colab
- Basic understanding of NLP and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Hugging Face Transformers library

## Usage

1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
    - [Fine_Tuning_LLMs_with_Hugging_Face.ipynb]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DtIK8E3y1ecPnF-OYLi-DhAeKVNy5kou#scrollTo=WVa0caPZlogN])

2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to fine-tune your language model.

## Structure
